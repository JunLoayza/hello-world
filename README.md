Learning the ropes

Dear humans and robots,

Kim and I had a wonderful evening cooking Blue Apron and watching Monk. Juniper will be here very soon. I have less than a month to complete the story for Humble Bee and finalize the UX and requirements for the Gliffy Admin Panel/Console.

Oh, and I can't forget updating the yukaichou.com and octalysisprime.com websites with a redesign.

No pain, no gain.
